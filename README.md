## Distributed Systems Coupling Analysis

The project consists of the following parts:
1. The plugin that seamlessly integrates with your SpringBoot app and logs API requests and database access.
2. The app that analyses the logs and stores them in the graph database.
3. The simulation of the system discussed in [the blog post](https://ilyazinkovich.github.io/2018/04/08/database-coupling.html).
